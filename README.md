## Customization

### Modifying SDG Content

Each SDG page can be customized by editing the corresponding HTML file in the `goals/` directory:

```html
<!-- Change the goal title and description -->
<h2 class="goal-title">Goal 2: Zero Hunger</h2>
<p class="goal-description">End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.</p>
```

### Styling

The platform's appearance can be customized by modifying the CSS in the `css/styles.css` file:

```css
/* Change the primary color for a specific goal */
.goal-2 .goal-title {
    color: #d3a029; /* Custom color for Goal 2 */
}
```

### Adding New Features

The core functionality can be extended by modifying the JavaScript in `js/main.js`:

```javascript
// Example: Add comment functionality to posts
function addComment(postId, commentText) {
    // Implementation details
}
```
